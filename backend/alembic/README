Generic single-database configuration for Alembic migrations.

## Creating a new migration

To create a new migration after modifying models:

```bash
# Auto-generate migration from model changes
docker-compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Or create an empty migration
docker-compose exec backend alembic revision -m "description of changes"
```

## Running migrations

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Upgrade by one version
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade +1

# Downgrade by one version
docker-compose exec backend alembic downgrade -1

# Show current version
docker-compose exec backend alembic current

# Show migration history
docker-compose exec backend alembic history
```

## Initial Setup

The initial migration creates all tables defined in the models:
- users
- student_profiles
- classes
- topics
- topic_prerequisites
- concepts
- questions
- question_attempts
- concept_mastery
- study_plans
- sync_operations

All tables include appropriate indexes for performance optimization.
